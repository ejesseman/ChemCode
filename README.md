Chemistry Quiz 
Gives students the chance to put their chemistry knowledge to the test by guess an element's symbol or atomic number, or guess the element itself by its symbol or atomic number.
The program divides the elements into their respective groups, which are saved a text files containing the name, symbol, and atomic number.
Once the user chooses the group, the user will then be asked what element property (symbol or atomic number) they wnat to quiz themselves on.
Once the user chooses the group, the user will then be asked what element property (symbol or atomic number) they wnat to quiz themselves on.
The user will then be asked how they want to be quized.
For example: say the user chose the symbol property, the program will than ask if they want to guess the element's symbol or guess the element it self by the symbol.
Once the quiz proceeds, the user will have five chances to guess the correct answer. After the fifth attempt, the program will display the correct answer.
Whether they answer it correctly or not, the program will then ask if the user wishes to try again, quiz themselves on a different group, or just exit.
